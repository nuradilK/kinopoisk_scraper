# About
This code scrapes top 250 movies according to kinopoisk. When I started to write this code, I encountered a problem with a firewall of kinopoisk. After couple of requests, the firewall starts to return a captcha.  However, I managed to avoid the captcha by filling the requests with headers and making time gaps between each request. 
# Todos
  - Add data about director and cast.
  - Add ratings of director and cast.
  - Add avg rating of cast.
# Important
The scrapper is not finished yet. In the near future, I am planning to add columns avg rating of a cast and director.
# Plans
After compleating the scraper, I want to create a machine learning model to predict a total gross of a movie using the scrapped data to train the model.
