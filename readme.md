# About
This code scrapes top 250 movies according to kinopoisk. When I started to write this code, I encountered a problem with a firewall of kinopoisk. After couple of requests, the firewall starts to return a captcha.  However, I managed to avoid a captcha by filling the requests with headers and making time gaps between each request. 
# To do
Add data about director and cast.
Add ratings of director and cast.
Add avg rating of cast.
Clean the data
# Important
The scrapper is not finneshed. It needs some coreection in the code, since kinopoisk does not have some information about movies. In brief, I have to clean the data.
